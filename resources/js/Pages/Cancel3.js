					As a leading retailer of digital products, Best Dropship Spy relies on
					this Return and Cancellation Policy to ensure customer
					satisfaction with every purchase.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a customer contacts us by phone or email, our initial
					response is to assist getting technical support or customer
					service for the customer of the product that the customer
					purchased. However, in some cases a product may be
					unsatisfactory to the customer for reasons completely
					beyond our control, in which case a return or a
					cancellation may be processed.

					Best Dropship Spy'S PRODUCT RETURN POLICY
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our return policy for all Best Dropship Spy products is as follows:
				</p>
				<div>
					<p>
						Customers requesting a return after expiration of the
						return period set forth in the applicable Return Policy
						will be required to work directly with the technical
						support or customer service.
					</p>
					<p>
						If a customer requests a return and the return is
						approved by Best Dropship Spy, the money for the requested
						transaction is refunded back to the customer, in part
						or whole. If the return is for a recurring billing
						product, then the return policy allows for the most
						recent payment to be refunded. Multiple payment returns
						can be provided as long as they are within the
						applicable Return Policy. A return on a recurring
						billing product will also result in cancellation.
						Returns will only be credited back to the account used
						to make the original purchase. If the original account
						has been closed, the purchase is not eligible for
						return.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a product is returned, the customer generally
						receives a full refund. Due to the digital format of
						Best Dropship Spy products, when a product is returned the customer
						retains the product and, in many cases, the customer
						has received a benefit from the product prior to the
						return. In such cases, Best Dropship Spy reserves the right to
						issue a refund for less than the full purchase price.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold' id="REFUNDS">
					REASONS WHY A PURCHASE MAY BE REFUNDED
				</h2>
				<p>
					Best Dropship Spy has every incentive to keep customers happy by
					providing quality products and service. To promote customer
					satisfaction, Best Dropship Spy reserves the right to reverse a sale,
					including but not limited to the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the customer provides a valid reason for requesting
						a return within the time frame permitted in the
						applicable Return Policy;
					</li>
					<li>
						If the customer provides a valid report that the charge
						was fraudulent or unauthorized;
					</li>
					<li>
						In order to comply with credit card industry rules, ACH
						industry rules, PayPal terms of service, U.S. law, and
						requests from verified US judiciary or law enforcement
						agents; or
					</li>
					<li>
						For any other reason Best Dropship Spy deems appropriate.
					</li>
				</ul>

					Best Dropship Spy'S CANCELLATION POLICY
				</h2>
				<p>
					A customer may cancel a product with a recurring billing
					subscription at any time. A cancellation means that no
					future payments are charged to the customer's account. The
					cancellation of a recurring billing product does not
					generate a refund - it will only stop any future payments.
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold' id="CANCEL">
					Best Dropship Spy'S REFUND POLICY
				</h2>
				<p>
					We offer a 7-day money back guarantee. If you sign up for
					Best Dropship Spy and find that it's not a perfect fit, please send a
					cancellation request by email to support@bestdropshipspy.com from the
					registered email address
				</p>
				<p>
					To cancel your subscription, we will need the following
					information: your billing information (name, transaction
					ID, etc.), email address, login name, and a brief comment
					explaining if you would like a refund.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your cancellation request comes from the email address
					other than registered email address we will ask you
					additional information including but not limited to:
					registered email, last 4 digits of the credit card
					associated with the account, billing date etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will refund your money if a request is made within 7
					days after your billing date.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your refund request will typically be processed within 10
					days of receiving it. The refund for the net price of your
					claim will be processed through the same method as the
					original payment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Customers requesting serial or repeated returns may be
					blocked from making further purchases using the Best Dropship Spy
					services.
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold' id="ABUSE">
					ABUSE OF THE RETURN POLICY
				</h2>
				<p>
					Customers requesting serial or repeated returns may be
					blocked from making further purchases using the Best Dropship Spy
					services. Customers that violate the terms of use of a
					product may have their right of return revoked for such
					product.
