				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
				</h2>
				<p>
					As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
					automatically and store it in log files. This information
					may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
					internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the
					files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics,
					etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or
					clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and
					administer the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Best Dropship Spy and its partners use cookies or similar technologies
					to analyze trends, administer the website, track users'
					movements around the website, and to gather demographic
					information about our user base as a whole. You can control
					the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if

					THIRD PARTY TRACKING
				</h2>
				<p>
					Third parties also use cookies and other tracking
					technologies on our site, of which data is only collected

				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					BEHAVIORAL TARGETING / RE-TARGETING
				</h2>
				<p>
					We partner with a third party ad network to either display
					advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on
					other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web
					beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information
					about your activities on this and other websites. This
					information is used to provide you targeted advertising
					across the internet, based upon your interests. If you wish
					to not have this information used for the purpose of

				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					MOBILE DEVICE DATA
				</h2>
				<p>
					When users download, install and use Best Dropship Spy services on
					their mobile phone or other wireless telecommunications
					device, Best Dropship Spy automatically gathers information, including
					without limitation, carrier providers, unique device
					identifiers, geo-location information (if allowed by the
					user), the types of mobile devices accessing the services,
					and the types of operating systems accessing the services
					(collectively, "Mobile Device Data"). A unique device
					identifier is a string of alphanumeric characters (similar
					to a serial number) used to uniquely identify and
					distinguish each mobile phone or other wireless
					communications device. Location services can be enabled or
					disabled at any time, through the settings on your mobile
					device. Best Dropship Spy uses Mobile Device Data to understand usage
					patterns and to improve our goods, services and
					functionality of our Sites.

					and special offers specific to you. Out of respect for your
					privacy, you can unsubscribe to our emails by clicking
					"unsubscribe" within each email. You may not opt-out of
					service-related communications, which are not promotional
					in nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to
					whether you want to allow websites to collect personally
					identifiable information over time about your online
					activities across different websites or online services. At
					this time our websites do not respond to the preferences
					you may have set in your web browser regarding the
					collection of your information, and our websites may
					continue to collect information in the manner described in
					this Privacy Policy. We may enable third parties to collect
					information in connection with our websites. This Privacy
					Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for,
					any collection of information by third parties on our

				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our most common practices with respect to the disclosure of
					personal information include the following:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Consent.</strong>
					We may disclose your personal information to third parties
					with your consent. You may give your consent in several
					ways, such as through a written agreement that you sign or
					acknowledge; an online method, such as a "click through"
					agreement or registration page; through a mobile
					application which you install on your mobile device or by
					enrolling in a text alert program; or through the terms and
					conditions under which we provide you a particular product
					or service. Sometimes your consent may be implied. For
					example, if you purchase products with a credit card and
					have them shipped to your home, you implicitly consent to
					the disclosure of your name and address to a third-party
					shipping company to complete the delivery, and of your
					credit card number to the credit card processor to
					authorize the transaction and to the bank to collect
					payment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Affiliated Businesses.</strong>
					We may share your personal information with our parent or
					affiliated businesses, joint venturers or promotion
					partners, for their use in a manner similar to the purposes
					described in this Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Agents/Service Providers.</strong>
					We use third party service providers to assist us in
					providing our services and websites, including database
					backup providers to protect our data, and a fraud
					prevention service. We may disclose your personal
					information to third parties who complete transactions or
					perform services on our behalf or for your benefit. We may
					also utilize the services of third parties to verify
					customer data, or to supplement other information we have
					collected. We may also contract with third parties to host
					a site, conduct market research, or send you information
					regarding our products or services or those of other
					companies with whom we conduct business. All service
					providers are authorized to use your personal information
					only as necessary to provide their respective services to
					us.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Marketing.</strong>
					We may send offers to selected groups of our customers on
					behalf of other businesses. We also may disclose the
					personal information we collect to third parties for their
					own direct marketing purposes. Such marketing may include,
					without limitation: (i) contacting you to complete
					purchases that you initiated but did not complete; and (ii)
					contacting you to purchase additional or related product to
					those you previously purchased. Upon request, Best Dropship Spy will
					provide a list of categories of personal information
					disclosed to third parties for marketing purposes, and the
					third parties to whom such information has been disclosed,
in the preceding 12 months. You may contact					<a href="mailto:support@bestdropshipspy.com">support@bestdropshipspy.com</a> to
					receive this information, and Best Dropship Spy will provide it within
					30 days.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Legal Process.</strong>
					We may disclose your personal information as required by
					law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal
					process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure
					is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or
					the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
					government request.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Certain Business Transfers.</strong>
					Your personal information may be disclosed as part of a
					corporate business transaction, such as a merger,
					acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of company
					assets, and could be transferred to a third party as one of
					the business assets in such a transaction. It may also be
					disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or
					receivership. We will use reasonable efforts to direct any
					such transferee to use your personal information in a
					manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on
					our website of any change in ownership or uses of your
					personally identifiable information, as well as any choices
					you may have regarding your personally identifiable
					information.
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					SECURITY
				</h2>
				<p>
					The security of your personally identifiable information is
					important to us. When you enter sensitive information such
					as credit card number on our registration or order forms,
					we encrypt that information using SSL.
				</p>
				<p>
					We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
					the personally identifiable information submitted to us,
					both during transmission and once we receive it. No method
					of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
					storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we
					strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
					personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee
					its absolute security.
				</p>
				<p>
					The information we collect about you is stored in limited
					access servers. We maintain safeguards to protect the
					security of these servers and your personally identifiable
					information. We retain personally identifiable information
					only as long as necessary to complete a purchase, thwart
					fraud, or provide customer service.
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					BLOGS
				</h2>
				<p>
					If you use a bulletin board, blog, or open forum on this
					website, you should be aware that any personally
					identifiable information you submit there may be read,
					collected, or used by other users of these forums, and
					could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not
					responsible for the personally identifiable information you
					choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of
					your personally identifiable information from our blog,
testimonials or community forum, contact us at					<a href="mailto:support@bestdropshipspy.com">support@bestdropshipspy.com</a>.
					In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally
					identifiable information, in which case we will let you
					know if we are unable to do so and why.
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

				<p>
					We display customer testimonials on our website in addition
					to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your
					testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or
delete your testimonial, you can contact us at					<a href="mailto:support@bestdropshipspy.com">support@bestdropshipspy.com</a>
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					LINKS TO OTHER SITES
				</h2>
				<p>
					If you click on a link to a third party site you will leave
					our site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot
					control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept
					responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable
					information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee
					that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us.
					We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
					other service provider from whom you request services.
				</p>

					Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the
					Facebook Like button and Twitter button or interactive
					mini-programs that run on our website. These Features may
					collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our
					website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to
					function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are
					either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our
					Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by
					the privacy policy of the company providing it.
				</p>
				<h2 className='text-2xl mt-2 mb-2 p-4 font-bold'>

					CHANGES IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY
				</h2>
				<p>
					If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post
					those changes to this Privacy Policy and other places we
					deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information
					we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if
					any, we disclose it.

					time, so please review it frequently. If we make material
					changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email,
